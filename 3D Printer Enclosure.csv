I bought it for printing ABS on my Ender 3 V2. Replaced the standard glass with a PEI flex steel plate and it was sticking better but I may have to use ABS Goo to get it stuck well enough.

I was able to put stops on the 4 front, and back frame tubes to keep them from sliding together all the way. This gave me enough clearance for the printer to fit and operate properly. I 3D printed a light bracket that snaps on the top frame tubes, so I could add LED lights on top, as it is quite dark inside without lights. The enclosure does keep the temperature stable and helps keep the humidity low. When printing PLA, the temp stays about 95 deg. F and 10 to 15 % RH. I have not had any warping or adhesion problems since placing the printer in the enclosure. It was easy to assemble. It unzips from the bottom front all the way to the back of the top, for easy printer access. So far I have no complants with this product.","Less than ten minutes to set up, put the printer inside, and started a test by heading the bed and end. I have a cold garage, during the winter it gets down to 49°F, and drafty with the doors open. This was a godsend, as I can now do abs filament without trouble. Interior temps were around 77-87°F depending on the filament types and the heat from the bed and end, again dependant on the type of filament. The Velcro around the bottom openings seems high grade. The stiching at the openings and zipper are tough. The zippered opening is larger, with a small Velcro patch to hold it up when just flapped. The plastic window is just that, it's still a bit hard to see through from the creases while flat packaged, but the heat has helped it form and unroll.Best one out there I would say.","Does what it is supposed to. I havent been able to print in ABS for years. Easy to assemble. It does a great job of maintaining a hight temp, keeps the smell of ABS down and the loud fans are hardly noticeable. its worth it just for the lower fan noise.

By then I had already found an assembly video online. oppsies. Definitely make sure you flip the hidden recessed power switch (based on your country) or your printer won't do anything but turn on and off. This is my first printer, so I learned a lot and had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I've made about 20 prints and the change in my skill is pretty visible from one to the next. I was concerned about layer lines being super visible with a non-resin machine but they're hardly noticeable and PLA is much safer to breathe. I had run out of filament while I was away at work. I reloaded and the print picked up exactly where it had left off with no noticeable marks. I will say, that you should definitely do research before buying a printer if it's your first. There is a lot of information out there that might be overwhelming but learning basic maintenance, bed adhesion, and how to use supports are going to be major factors on your prints working. I had purchased an autoleveler but it was very finicky and leveling manually isn't that terrible once you understand what you're doing. It takes me about a minute to get my bed leveled perfectly now so don't waste your money on one. Overall, this is one of the best things I've bought. Ever.","We got it for our teen for Christmas. He has some engineering aspirations and needs something to express his creativity. Also, turns out it is very useful in any household.

Thanks for the protection!,Wanted this as insurance against possible resin leaks. Was a little tough to install however after some attempts i got it on without air bubbles. I think its best to use a few more alcohol wipes than what is included to ensure the screen is clean and keep wiping..even when u think its clean..use another....then it should work..Customer support was awesome...great product. Thanks,Got my 2 screens in for my Elegoo Saturn. Went to apply the first one and spent close to 45 minutes trying to work all the bubbles out with a credit card. Had noticed a small crinkle in the screen as I started but wasnt about to give up so easily on it. Finally had to concede and pulled out the second screen that went on super fast pretty easily. contacted the seller and told them my issue and they sent me a replacement pair to make up for the first screen of 2 having issues.

Well Made, Sturdy and Huge!",This Kywoo 3D Printer Enclosure is Pricey - Works Well - Bigger Than I Needed For Neptune 2,Perfect for Ender 5 pro,Very nice!,"This enclosure arrived yesterday, so I assembled it and tried it out right away.The assembly was very simple, but I didn’t expect it to be as large as it was. This thing is really big, and it should fit any of those larger printers with ease. My Creality CR-6 SE had plenty of room inside of it, with room to spare to also store some rolls of filament on the side.There is a zippered flap that has a clear window for viewing your print progress, and it opens along the front and top so that you have plenty of access to the printer without needing to take it out for servicing.The left side is just a flat cover, with no features. The right side has a fairly large pocket near the front edge, and near the bottom by the rear edge is a port for routing your cables in.On the top is a Velcro sealed opening that is perfect for changing out the filament spool in a top-mounted spool holder. If you have a really tall printer with a top mounted spool holder, you can just leave this flap open.The inside is coated with a reflective material that will help to keep the heat inside.I tested it overnight with a larger PLA model that I was having some trouble with, and it’s almost complete and looks perfect so far. It was very warm inside the cover when I unzipped it to check, so it seems to be doing its job very well.I was considering building my own enclosure, but this does the job perfectly. As long as you have the room to use this, it is the perfect solution. The material seems very durable and the stitching is all very well done. This is really a premium enclosure.","I am really impressed at how well this is made. It seems a little intimidating when the box is first opened but it is very simple to put together. It took me about ten minutes.The frame is solid and study when assembled. Just follow the numbers in the diagram and it will assemble easily.The cover fits tightly but unzips enough that it does not have to be pulled or stretched to fit. The cover is extremely easy to slip on and easy to remove.The overall size of this is great. It is 28 inches deep, 25.5 inches wide and 28.7 inches high. This will hold some good size printers.There is a flap on top that can be opened allowing a tall printer with top mounted spool to be placed inside.The hole in the back right side is well suited for the power cable and anything else that needs to connect externally. I also have a filament dryer inside and have the power cord running externally.The front opening is large and makes it very easy to access the printer. Super easy to zip and unzip.This is a high-quality enclosure. If you need an enclosure to help with ABS printing, I can highly recommend this one.","I am working on printing parts for a Voron v2.4 DIY CoreXY printer. The printed parts are of ABS filament. ABS filament produces strong, very nice looking parts. However, without an enclosure this filament will warp and cause part print failure more than 50% of the time. By using this enclosure the parts will print perfectly every time, without warping.I like the high reflectivity of the inside area. It makes it easy to see inside with on LED light. It also cuts down the noise coming from the printer.Assembly wasn't real hard, just a little awkward. Having a second set of hands (my wife) made it easier. The parts and material are good quality and the parts fit together well.All in all I am happy I got this enclosure. Well worth a full 5 stars.","Because of the way the Ender 5 Pro is built, you need a little extra room in the top to allow for the Bowden and control cables to move freely, and you don't want the print head carriage to rub. This enclosure is perfect for that - the frame holds together and holds the shape of the enclosure so that it doesn't rub or catch while running. There's enough space around the printer that I have a filament dryer inside, feeding filament through a bowden and up to the print head, and there's plenty of clearance so that it doesn't catch at all. If you're printing anything that's sensitive to drafts or that tends to warp off the bed, an enclosure is really a must, and this will do the job at a great price. Recommend.","I put a TRONXY X5SA-PRO in this Enclosure, not my best printer but definitely my biggest. Nice fit with several inches to spare in all directions. Small children may want to use it as a fort. Besides the large zip up opening, there is about a 9' by 12 scuddle hatch on the top.The opening unzips giving total access to the front and top of the printer.It is pretty easy to assemble, like setting up a small tent. After assembling my son and I just lifted the printer up and passed it in through the top opening. The little pouch on the side is a perfect size for the printer manual. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",6,5,https://www.amazon.com/Enclosure-Fireproof-Dustproof-Temperature-Protective/dp/B094NKB64P/ref=sr_1_12_sspa?keywords=3D+Printer+Enclosure&qid=1640809226&sr=8-12-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFOWU00RkVUV1pTQUsmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA0Njc4OTQxSkw3RThPTlMzVFQyJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA4NjkzNjIxTlpRRzg4WlZRVDAyJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

There's a little bit of extra room on all sides and PLENTY of vertical space. Honestly probably a bit too much, but it helps prevent the enclosure from getting too hot. Since the only Creality one that fit was absolutely massive, I'm happy this worked out.I haven't tested the fireproof claim, but the outside of the enclosure seems to be made of an electrical tape sort of material. The inside has some silver fabric. I've had it for about a month now and it's held up well. The plastic window was pretty wrinkly at first, but using a hair dryer smoothed it out. It's still not ideal, but I figure it'll soften up with time. It's certainly a lot cheaper than an acrylic enclosure.I wish there were pockets on both sides, but that's really my only small complaint. There's no light, so I wrapped an LED strip around the poles at the top and threaded it through the side hole. There's actually two openings, one in the back and one on the left side, but I just put all the cables through the velcroed side hole. You could probably rig up a HEPA filter fan with the other hole (which I think is where the power cord should be) to reduce VOCs.The enclosure itself raises the ambient temperature a bit, so I would recommend keeping the flap open if you're going to be printing with PLA. There's a strip of velcro up on top and on the front of the flap which holds it open and has come in very handy. You could probably open the top up too if you're really worried about temperatures, but so far I have no had to. I noticed a roughly 5 - 8 degree difference vs ambient temperature with the flap open and a 15-20 degree difference with the flap closed. However, the thermometer I bought is just a cheap one from a local hardware store, so take those numbers with a grain of salt.Finally, I noticed it holds in VOCs/smells in very well. (That also means be careful when cleaning with alcohol! Clean your plate outside the enclosure if it's removeable or else make sure the fumes are gone before printing.) It doesn't really reduce the noise level much, but I kind of expected that.Overall, I'm very pleased with it. Hopefully I never have to test its flammability rating, but for now I feel pretty safe leaving my printer alone.","I like the tent, has everything I needed and is pretty sturdy.

The build is simple but sturdy. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised how well designed, large and strong this printer tent enclosure is. Also, The insulation and heat reflective material that this enclosure is made from works great. With, the simple design of this 3D printer tent enclosure; no tools required, it should take about 15 minutes to assemble it.I’m very happy with this purchase.P.S. Don’t forget to detach and move your power supply to the out side of the enclosure.","I'd had my eyes on building an enclosure for awhile more for safety and dust than anything. I printed for months without problems and now started having adhesion issues which I realized was likely due to finally reaching winter with my printer. So I decided it was enclosure time, right about the time this became available. It's only day one with it, but my adhesion issues on a specific piece haven't occurred yet (farther into the print than I was able to get before) though I did also install the BLTouch at the same time. The enclosure was VERY easy to put together, fits the Ender 3 Pro well and I was amazed at how warm it was inside when I unzipped it. I'm excited to try printing with other filaments (besides PLA) now just because I can! I put LEDs I'd had for a vanity mirror that I wasn't using inside the case and my octoprint gets an even better image than it ever did before thanks to the reflection all around. Definitely worth it over the hassle of trying to build your own.","I have multiple printers set up in my office and with them running, I was always sweating. I would open the window (in the winter) to try to help myself keep cool, but the resulting breeze would cause the prints to cool prematurely. Enter the tent. I set it up for one printer last night and have it as the only printer I am running at the moment. I am able to sit in my office with the enclosure fully zipped shut and be comfortable. It was worth the purchase of these to enclose all of my Ender 3 printers!",Bought this so I could print ABS on my Ender 3 Pro and maintain a consistent temperature. Assembly was simple and only took about 10 minutes. Seems to be well built.,"Doing a lot of 3D printing during this COVID pandemic for medical personnel.I had a lot of temperature issues in my house and keeping a consistent temp is important for adhesion to the bed as well as to minimize warping. This worked great to shield my printer from the breeze that would be created as my two boys ran through the house. I have it in my basement now, which is about 10F degrees cooler than upstairs.

It's quite large enough for the printer to fully operate inside! Most excellent!","This was extremely easy to assemble with a little stretching initially of the fabric to get it over the tube framework. The Ender 3 (Pro) fits very comfortably inside with plenty of room in all dimensions. Seals well with the velcro closures that are well-positioned. Perhaps a bit on the pricy side for what it is, but certainly a very fast path to a well-fitted, fire-resistant enclosure vs. building something custom. Highly recommended.It didn't appear to provide significant sound attenuation; I noticed no real difference in sound level. It's also designed around the spool in the stock location on top, which some users don't prefer. The primary concern with the spool location seems to be wear at the extruder, but my Pro had a brass insert and I'm seeing no issues with feed or cross-loading the insert. It can also be a little awkward to work inside of, but the fully-opening front helps a bunch. Definitely needs a light either on the printer itself or inside the case. You'll want to print a temp tower as the ambient temperature can have an impact on printing.","I have a TL:D3 pro in a room used for drying soaps. Unfortunately this also makes the room cold and very drafty but the upside is low humidity. I NEEDED an enclosure.Now I have perfect prints every time and the enclosure is not super insulated so, with the room itself at about 68 F, the ambient temp inside the enclosure is a reasonable 84F.

I've gone through everything that is shipped from 3D Sourcerer and am very impressed with the parts quality and design of this Enclosure. I'd spent a lot of time looking at competing solutions from the Czech Republic, France, and a couple other 3D Enclosure companies right here in the US. In the end, this was the Enclosure that touched all the important points of my needs and desires.Having gone through everything that is shipped in the Kit, the first thing that impresses me is the 5mm thickness of the Plexiglas panels. If anyone thinks that this kit isn't priced right, they need to go and price 5mm panels from reputable sources. I did that and trust me, you are getting a bargain at this price when you consider the thickness, pre-cut and drilled and then all the additional parts that are sent with this Kit.This Kit is a lot more than the Plexiglass, and here are some more observations:- Very good quality materials in the included hardware (for assembly).- Real metal, ball-bearings for the Filament Spools of good quality.- A Hygrometer/Temperature readout that is actually useful and fairly accurate.- Quality, all-metal hinges that operate very smoothly.- Cables for extending the Prusa Control Panel outside the Enclosure.- And other parts that all speak of the quality in selection by this company.- I loved that you packaged all the parts in separate, logical, sealed, heavy-plastic bags (well done)!Beyond the above, and if you've ever designed your own 3D parts in CAD, this company provides some of the best 3D Parts designs I've seen. The choices are many, which for me was ""welcomed"" because I want to have options and print these parts in the colors of my choosing. This company has (36) files of Parts for this Enclosure (on the Prusa website) and they are very well designed. So, if you are looking for these files, they are easily and publicly available at:https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/40715-universal-3d-printer-enclosure-standard-build-by-3/filesI'm so very pleased that choosing this product has (thus far) exceeded my expectations and particular interests in a see-through 3D Enclosure.I only have one note to share with the ""3D Sourcerer"" company intended as a helpful observation. Amazon handed off the delivery of this product to UPS. UPS nearly had it destroyed by the time it arrived on my end. I'm guessing that Amazon may have given it to UPS due to the weight (~35lbs) and size of this package. I believe that my package was one UPS drop-kick away from tearing it apart. Two of the several Bands to keep the package together were torn off and gone by the time I got it. All of the necessary Styrofoam inside the box was broken into pieces, and I had Styrofoam bits all over the place. Your double boxing of the Plexiglas and other Parts helped prevent loss from UPS's rough handling.I just wanted to share that with you, and this is in no way a criticism of your company or Amazon. UPS has had a bad reputation (for decades) of very hard handling of large and/or heavy packages. I order products fairly often that fit that category and when I have the choice, I always pick a shipper other than UPS.Great Job on this 3D Enclosure and I wish you a lot of success!!",I anticipated wishing I had sourced all the materials myself... But I am not in a place where I could easily do that. The available models to print and the included instructions were quite straightforward. This kit really did include everything I needed to make a killer enclosure and instantly improve my print quality and go from 60-75% humidity down to 25%. Plenty of hardware to expand the kit and I honestly am thinking I'd like the same thing but smaller for my Prusa Mini I just ordered.Best enclosure kit I've seen.,"Not sure about the one star review and how the product deserves a 1 star rating. This is a 5 star product in my opinion. The packing and delivery is impecable. The build is exact and plenty of customization is available to the user for external cable routing, tools and filament feeds. One can download all the required parts from the Prusa 3D models website and several others.Very easy to put together and a great resulting product to protect your favorite 3D printer.",Happy with the design as well as all of the extra support for customizing and printing the necessary parts required. Parts were all high quality and were delivered without any damage.,"I really like this enclosure. Worth the investment.It is truly universal in that it is a good size, fits the standard ikea lack table, has STLs for multiple configurations, etc.For the price, which is comparable to other enclosures, you get nice thick panels, and a lot of extras in nuts, bolts, cables and bearings to handle the different options you may want to add.I had been shopping for an enclosure that would handle having the paver in place (for noise control) and still have room.It did take a few days to print all the parts (see the last picture for an example of my original “cheap” enclosure printing parts).It took me an hour and a half to assemble once the printing was done. I had no issues with the build.Check out the extendable options in the later part of the assembly guide.I plan to add a PalettePro in the future and this enclosure is already designed to hold the MMU or Palette add-on!One recommendation for anyone building this: I did realize after finishing that I wanted more of the modular corner pieces for venting and cables, so I’m printing more. If I were to start over, I’d avoid wasting filament and just print more of the corner pieces that had the slide out parts.",9,8,https://www.amazon.com/Universal-3D-Enclosure-Compatible-Multi-Material/dp/B07ZYM7P6Y/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=3D+Printer+Enclosure&qid=1640809226&sr=8-8
